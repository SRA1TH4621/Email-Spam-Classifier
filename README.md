# Email-Spam-Classifier

# Email Spam Classifier (ML Project)

## 🔍 Overview
A Machine Learning model that classifies emails as spam or ham using NLP techniques such as Bag-of-Words / TF-IDF with classifiers like Naïve Bayes.

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing (stopwords, stemming, normalization)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Naïve Bayes classifier
- Interactive prediction
- High accuracy (92–95%)
